## My process

### Built with

- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

This was the first project that I used CSS Grid. 

I will admit that I used CSS Grid with CSS Flexbox. I did this because I've always heard from the internet that Grid is great for outlining your page and flexbox is great doing everything else. I took this a tried it out coming from a place were I've only used flexbox to do everything. I got say, they're right. It was significantly easier to outline the webpage using Grid. And by easier I mean, it took less code.  

### Continued development

I'm going to expand my skills in Grid going forward. Perhaps the next project I'm going to use nothing but Grid to see how each technology does the job.
